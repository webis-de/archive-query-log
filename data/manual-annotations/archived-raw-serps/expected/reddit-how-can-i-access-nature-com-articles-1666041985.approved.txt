We are a nation of immigrants, after all. In the tech world, we often talk about a startup\u2019s \u201cunfair advantage\u201d that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage, and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur.\n\nAs many of you know, I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide.\n\nA little over a century ago, a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy, the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians, including my great grandmother, found sanctuary in Aleppo, Syria\u2014before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained, rather they found this message:\n\n<em>\u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d</em>\n\nMy great grandfather didn\u2019t speak much English, but he worked hard, and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton, NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children, all born in the U.S., immigration continued to reshape their family, generation after generation. The one son they had\u2014my grandfather (here\u2019s his AMA)\u2014volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother, a native of Hamburg, Germany, decided to leave her friends, family, and education behind after falling in love with my father, who was born in San Francisco.\n\nShe got a student visa, came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair, uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left, but she didn't. After she and my father married, she received a green card, which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German, but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I\u2019ll never forget her swearing in ceremony.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens, it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with, simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here, to create value and jobs for these United States.\n\nMy forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I\u2019ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. \n\nWithout them, there\u2019s no me, and there\u2019s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let\u2019s not forget that we\u2019ve thrived as a nation because we\u2019ve been a beacon for the courageous\u2014the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed.\n\nRight now, Lady Liberty\u2019s lamp is dimming, which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines\u2014past, present, and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit, whether it's calling your representative (this works, it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA), marching in protest, donating to the ACLU, or voting, of course, and not just for Presidential elections.\n\nOur platform, like our country, thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit, Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.\n\n\u2014Alexis\n\n<em>And for all of you American redditors who are immigrants, children of immigrants, or children\u2019s children of immigrants, we invite you to share your family\u2019s story in the comments.</em>",

I quit and needed something fast at night while I look for something better during the day. \n\nIt was a data entry position, meaning I get an email containing the details of an order and proceeding to input the information into our system. \n\nRight after my training I knew this is something Autohotkey can do, I don't know to code that well, so I went to a freelancer website to hire a guy to develop the code, it cost me a two-month salary....\n\nI just had to input how many orders I want to process per hour, since day 1 I was working from home because the company did not want to pay for transport or cleaning during the graveyard shift. \n\nFor the first 2 years, I would check if there was something the code cannot do (usually took me less than 5 minutes) and then I would let the computer running and watch movies, go to bed, sometimes I'd even go out. Then I added those functions to the code as well. \n\nI was doing such a remarkable job I was offered promotions a few times, new positions during the daytime that I'd reject stating I'm a very introverted person that enjoys this type of position.  \n\nEventually, I got another job, better paid, but there was no reason for me to quit where I was working. For my data entry job, I could spend months without having anybody reach out to me. \n\nSometimes some co-workers will try to match my order entry quota, which would make me open the code, and change an 8 to 9 to increase my production and keep myself on top. I'd change the numbers regularly \"just in case\" but nobody even noticed. \n\nI even got 2 salary raises at some point for never missing a day, and being the top producer in my 3 people department, to which I corresponded by changing the 9 and switching it to an 11 or 10 on some days. \n\nMy end. \n\nIt took them 4 years to develop new software that will replace my data entry position. Since clients were granted access to our new system. A few weeks ago I got my severance check, I was told I could keep the laptop and office equipment and that I'm welcome to apply for any position I want.\n\nI never talked about that with anybody IRL, not even my family, even my wife wasn't sure what my job was about with that other company. \n\nNow that it is over. There you go, my darkest work secret.\n\nI did try to schedule a demonstration of \"my code\", I think that was back in 2017. The regional manager told me they're very busy dealing with the important stuff, just to keep doing the good work I was doing.... which I fucking did until the day I was let go.",

I\u2019ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn\u2019t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children\u2019s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens\u2019 lungs daily.\n\n\n\nWhen I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe would have to agree to disagree\u201d he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.\n\nNot only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner\u2019s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn\u2019t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.\n\nA month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn\u2019t like what he was up to. \u201cWhat you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I\u2019m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,\u201d he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.\n\nLike most of my generation I was born a coal miner\u2019s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed\nfirst-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can\u2019t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.\n\nThe promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.\n\nIt\u2019s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don\u2019t want my children to\ninherit the struggles that we have had to endure. \n\nI\u2019m proud to be a Justice Democrat and a Brand New Congress candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I\u2019ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for. It also means I support the Brand New Congress platform, including Medicare for All, free public higher and vocational education, and moving to an expanded economy for West Virginia and America, based on renewable energy.\n\n<em>Social Media Links</em>:\n\nWebsite | Facebook | Twitter\n\n<em>Info Links</em>:\n\nBallotpedia | Wikipedia\n\n<em>Other Important Links</em>:\n\n\n\n/r/JusticeDemocrats\n\n/r/BrandNewCongress\n\n/r/Swearengin4Senate\n\n\nDonate to my campaign. | Sign up to volunteer. | Platform",

A lot has happened in the past two weeks so I'm going to try to go over it as best I can.\n\nMy wife and I started talking again. We had a very serious conversation and I did apologize for what I did to her running shoes, and then I told her I had to speak some truth and I wanted her to promise me that she wasn't going to roll her eyes, interrupt me, scoff, or get sarcastic with me, which she did. I told her that I was not kidding about my boots, that while most of the time I caught geriatric transports, falls, and nausea, there were instances where response time was of the essence and I didn't have time to play around with my boots in the middle of the night. I told her that there have been times when my intervention has been critical in saving a life, when my training has helped me recognize an underlying emergency, or when a call I made ensured that a patient was prioritized upon arrival at the hospital. I explained that a lot of the shit I see, I don't tell her about because I don't want to give her nightmares or make her worry about me. She actually listened and didn't dismiss what I had to say. She responded that she was trying to help by keeping things neat.\n\nI responded, \"But you're not. Sweetie, I'm not trying to be mean, but you're not helping. You're hindering me. One day it may be the difference between life and death. I need you to not touch my gear. It's where I know where it is, it's where I can easily find it in a short amount of time, and if you move it, you are impeding an emergency response. I don't care if it looks neat. It serves a function, it doesn't look pretty. If you want to help me, please leave my gear where I put it.\"\n\nA few nights later I had my friend Officer Rich come over. Officer Rich was one of the two cops that did CPR on the victim that night. The three of us sat on our deck and had a few social distancing beers. He talked about getting there, doing CPR, giving Narcan, waiting for the ambulance and getting her back shortly before we got there.\n\nHe then pulled out a few photos of car accidents that I had worked. He showed them to my wife and pointed out, \"This car went into a tree. Your husband crawled into the wreck, put a collar on the driver, and stayed in there giving him oxygen until we could get him out.\" \"Your husband pulled a three year old out of this wreck.\" \"Your husband recognized that the driver had a stroke and took her to a stroke center, which likely saved her life.\"\n\nAfter that, I told her I had something I wanted to show her and I asked her for the same promise I'd asked earlier. When she agreed, I showed her a video on YouTube of a police bodycam from an overdose. This video showed how critical time is in getting someone back, and the training someone goes through in order to give the drug, do CPR, and utilize an AED.\n\nI told her, \"I'm not trying to attack you, I don't want to have a fight, but I want you to understand what I go through. That I hope every call I go on is transporting a boo boo, because otherwise it means that if I don't do everything right someone could die. If I don't get out that door as quickly as possible, someone could suffer brain damage while they're waiting for me to give them oxygen. If I'm upset and shaking because I had to waste time opening my boots, I might miss something critical and someone might not make it.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that she understood and told me she hadn't really thought about the danger of what I do until the other night when she saw the photos of the wrecks. I told her that I think she has OCD and needs to see a therapist because it's hurting our marriage. I listed examples of her throwing important things out, moving things without permission, and messing with my gear. I offered to go together and said I'd be willing to work on things together.\n\nAfter I pointed out the pattern, she agreed that it was time to speak to someone. She wants to think about whether she wants to go together or go by herself, but she has promised me that she's going to try to change her patterns. I brought up her saying she thought I was going to hit her, and she acknowledged she'd been with guys who flew off the handle with little provocation and scared her. That she'd never seen me get that angry and it triggered her because she didn't think I was capable of blowing up like that.\n\nShe's been very emotional lately and has been going through mood swings. She's been worried about me going out on calls. The other day she started crying and said, \"I hope you know how much I appreciate what you do.\" Knock on wood, since we had the big talk, she hasn't touched my boots.\n\nIs everything resolved? Not by a longshot. But she seems to have a new appreciation for what I do. Thank you for all of your responses. I wound up not showing her the thread, because a lot of it was pretty harsh towards her. I recognize I cherry picked incidents that didn't put her in the best light, and there's a lot more to her and our marriage than that. She is the person I chose for the rest of my life, and I want us to work.\n\ntl;dr Let my wife into my world a little more, she let me into hers, and she hasn't touched my boots since.",

            "snippet": "<em>tl;dr:</em> Four years ago there was an EVE battle where $300,000 worth of stuff was destroyed, and it made the news.  After that battle, EVE\u2019s greatest player, The Mittani, made a bunch of money selling out his massive 15,000 person super-organized gaming community to other games for cash.  This went well, but then he tried to raise $150,000 in a kickstarter to get Sci-Fi Author Jeff Edwards to write a book about himself and a famous war he won in EVE Online.  The rest of the EVE player community revolted against this idea, the kickstarter fell short in spectacular fashion, and the community then united to destroy The Mittani\u2019s EVE empire once and for all, bank rolled by a massive EVE casino run by one guy.  Towards the end of that war, the guy who ran that casino was banned because the CS:GO gambling scandal made the game company behind EVE afraid of lawsuits related to gambling.  With no money bankrolling them, the EVE community split apart before they could deal the final blow, and now 15 months later, EVE\u2019s greatest player is back for revenge in what could be EVE Online\u2019s first $1,000,000 battle.\n\n\n\nHi, IAMA fleet commander in the MMO video game EVE Online.  EVE Online is the game that many of you \u201clove to read about, but would never actually play\u201d.  I don\u2019t blame you, it\u2019s a complicated time sink, and if you\u2019re not careful it can add a few years to your college career (plenty of people take 6 years to graduate though, so it\u2019s no big deal).  It\u2019s likely that the last time many of you read about this game was back in 2014 when roughly $300,000 worth of warships were destroyed in a single day, as reported by Wired, CBS, ABC, etc.  Well, nearly four years later, a crazy timeline of events has led us to what is going to be EVE Online\u2019s first $1,000,000 dollar battle, that will dwarf the size of the famous battle four years ago.  This battle will be occurring tomorrow at roughly 20:00 UTC (3 pm US Eastern).  Since plenty of you gamers enjoy reading about the crazy people who play EVE Online, I\u2019ve decided to type up a simple guide to the battle happening tomorrow as well as the unbelievable events that led up to it, so you can continue to read about EVE from a safe distance.\n\nA super basic guide to EVE Combat:\n\nEVE combat really isn\u2019t that hard to understand if you\u2019ve ever played even just a few video games and understand basic video game concepts.  EVE has many many ship classes, divided into three main groups: subcapital, capital, and super capital.  But there are really only two that matter: Titans (the biggest super capital class), and Force-Auxiliary Carriers (the only capital class ship that can efficiently heal capital and super capital ships).  Titans are the best ships in the game because they have the largest hitpoint pool by a large margin and they do the most damage.  Titans are also the most expensive ships in the game by a large margin, which is why two sides with lots of titans rarely fight each other, and when they do it tends to make the news.  The big fight that happened in 2014 that I mentioned above is the last time that two real titan fleets faced off against each other.  In that battle, each side fielded roughly 80 titans, with the losing side losing 59 titans and the winning side losing 16 titans.\nTomorrow, each side will field over 250 titans, and likely 1,000 support capitals and super capitals.  The story of how the game went from a 100 titan battle to a 500 titan battle in 4 years, with no big battles in between, is truly amazing and worth reading for even the most casual observers, but before I get into that here\u2019s a brief aside on why all the news media like to quote EVE battles in $$ values (hint: for clicks, but it\u2019s technically accurate).\n\nHow did $300,000 get destroyed four years ago?  And why is this a $1,000,000 battle?\n\nThough a majority players are content to just pay the monthly subscription and play the game, EVE Online has a convenient method for calculating the conversion rate of in-game currency (called ISK, I\u2019m going to use ISK from now on) to real world currency because it allows its players to buy \u201csubscription time\u201d and sell it on the in-game market for extra ISK.  Basically, I can take $15 dollars, buy a 30 day subscription code, put that on the in-game market, and someone can use ISK to buy that game time and play the game for free.  Using this, we can calculate the conversion rate for any ship or item to generate amazing headlines so the EVE players can justify how much time they all spend on this game.\n\nFun Fact: Just like other games with microtransactions, there are crazy people in EVE who blow stupid amounts of money on this game.  Not many EVE players know this, but the current Chinese Player group (Fraternity Coalition) has had their current war funded by one guy for the last two months, and he has spent $70,000 doing that, and they\u2019re still going to lose anyway, which is kind of hilarious.\n\nBut enough about that, let\u2019s get to the fun part, the crazy story of how the game got to where it is today.\n\nWhy are $1,000,000 worth of nerds facing off in a battle tomorrow?\n\nThe great thing about this story is that we can pick up right where we left off in 2014.  After that big giant battle, the winning side (The ClusterFuck Coalition, CFC from here on) were kings of the universe.  While they didn\u2019t own all of the space, it was clear that no one could challenge their power.  Their leader, The Mittani, had built the largest and most organized online gaming organization on the internet, with an estimated member count exceeding 15,000 people, and capable of summoning over 1,000 players to login to the game at a moment\u2019s notice.\nWith nothing left to conquer, he decided to try and grow the CFC into something even greater.  He had already started a gaming news website named after himself, so he started a Twitch channel to go along with it, and then started cozying up to people in the gaming industry.  He started approaching different gaming companies and offering to bring the CFC to their game if they would give them special promotions and free ingame items, and this worked.  They did this for Planetside 2 and H1Z1.  The Mittani would constantly push these promotions on his members in the CFC, and for the most part this went pretty well.\n\nThen, in late 2015, they decided to aim even higher.  The Mittani had somehow gotten to know Sci-Fi author Jeff Edwards, and convinced him to write a Sci-Fi book about a war that happened in EVE Online.  The Mittani was going to do a $150,000 kickstarter to pay Edward\u2019s fee, and his media machine spun into full action to attempt to raise the money from not just the CFC, but the entire EVE Online community.  There were two problems with this plan though: 1) The CFC was starting to turn on the idea of being constantly harassed for money, and 2) The war he wanted to write about was one that his side won, and The Mittani, famous among EVE players for his ego, was likely going to be the main character.  The final straw was when he renamed his gaming organization to \u2018The Imperium\u2019, because ClusterFuck Coalition wasn\u2019t advertiser friendly. The events surrounding the failed kickstarter are immortalized in one of /r/eve\u2019s greatest post\n\nThe EVE community was ready to revolt, but it took the richest person in EVE Online to get them all together into a cohesive coalition capable of defeating The Imperium/CFC.  That person was Lenny, who ran a wildly successful casino website where players could use ISK to play.  Bank Rolled with virtually infinite money, the newly formed Moneybadger Coalition absolutely steamrolled the Imperium in a few months, taking every single piece of land they owned.  The Imperium retreated out of their territory, and most of the Moneybadger Coalition was content to let them run away, satisfied that if the Imperium ever threatened again that Lenny would be there to throw money at the problem.Rock Paper Shotgun wrote a good summary of the war\n\nThen, the CS:GO Gambling scandal happened, and the company that makes EVE Online, CCP, became scared that lawsuits could start coming their way if they continued to allow a giant casino website to run using in game money.  This was exacerbated by the Imperium publicly whining and complaining about the casino website for weeks, until CCP made an announcement.  The announcement declared that gambling was no longer allowed with ISK, and that they had identified one player who was trading ISK for real life currency against the rules.  Though Lenny still denies it and no concrete evidence was ever provided, Lenny was banned from the game and all of his in game assets frozen.  Moneybadger's bank disappeared in a single day.\n\nIt was August 2016 by the time the dust settled, nearly 10 months after the failed kickstarter, and the galaxy slid into a semblance of peace.  But The Mittani swore revenge (publicly on his twitch channel), and what followed was the game\u2019s greatest arms race, with the Imperium/CFC and the former Moneybadger forces each building massive super capital fleets.  Over the past few months the Imperium has been hinting at a major invasion, even feigning a few attacks north into Moneybadger space.  But that time is now over.  Suddenly and without warning, the Imperium turned a harmless border skirmish into a full scale invasion, catching the Moneybadger forces with their pants down.\nTomorrow is the first decisive battle of this new war, it could potentially dwarf the famous battle from four years ago.\n\nSo what will actually happen?\n\nIn all likelihood?  Nothing.  And it\u2019s at this point that I must reveal the reason for typing this post.  You may be thinking, \u201cWow, EVE has a really engaged community for someone to take the time to type up a post like this\u201d, but oh how naive you are.  The purpose of this post is to point out that the fleet commanders on both sides of this battle are nothing but complete cowards.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you exactly what\u2019s going to happen.  The Mittani will hype his people up for hours, and the Moneybadger people will do the same.  Then their fleet commanders will get their fleets onto the field of battle and place them into their \u201csafe zones\u201d that they\u2019ve setup for themselves (it\u2019s a dumb new game mechanic).  Then, they will stare at each other for literally hours, and send out NPC drones that they barely control that mostly do nothing, while leaving all of their Titans in complete safety.  They will then each make up a bunch of excuses, declare the other side as \u201ccowardly\u201d for not directly charging into their defensive position, and tell everyone to log off from the game.\nDon\u2019t believe me?  Everyone in EVE knows this, even the players involved in tomorrow\u2019s battle.  I\u2019m serious, here was the top post on /r/eve for most of today from a group within the Imperium\n\nDon\u2019t let these people tell you it\u2019s \u201cthe game\u2019s fault that they can\u2019t fight each other\u201d, it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but their own.  I\u2019m just hoping that both sides don\u2019t end up staring at their computer screens for 8 hours tomorrow doing nothing, but that all depends on the fleet commanders.",

There was a few idiots telling me I needed to be Alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. \n\nAnyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning. \n\nI could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. \n\nI sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. \n\nI honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.\n\nWe hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours ,in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together. \n\nI know that this isn\u2019t a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. \n\nHowever I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.\n\nThank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her",

The mother got upset and demanded I pay for it.\n\nWell she(mother) and son showed up at my door around noon and apologized. She said that she misunderstood what happened and thought that I\u2019d done it on purpose to teach her son a lesson about leaving his stuff in my yard. I guess he explained to her it was his fault which I thought was commendable for someone his age. She told me that she just stressed about it because she is a single mother and doesn\u2019t really have the means to replace it at the moment and that if it was anything else she probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten so upset but he likes hanging out with other kids and that\u2019s how she keeps track of him.\n\nI told her about my spare phone (iPhone 7 his was a 6s). I also took the advice of some of the commenters that it might be damaging to just give it to him and that I should perhaps have him work for it. I have a detached garage and have been needing to clean it and told her if he wanted to help me I\u2019d give him the phone.\n\nHe instantly looked excited, I imagine he felt like he\u2019d never get a new phone, and she acted very grateful and said he could help.\n\nLeft and came back an hour later, just the son this time and we got started cleaning. Took about 4 hours, a lot of work but nothing too hard (he's just 12)\n\nI had a couple cords of firewood I wanted moved out and stacked into a rack and then a bunch of boxes I cut up and had him bag and carry to the curb, he swept, had a coke and a couple slices of pizza then got his phone.\n\nI had a talk with him about paying attention to his where his things are because it won\u2019t always work out like this.\n\nI also told him if he wants to mow my yard every weekend and his mom says he can I\u2019ll pay him $30 a week. (It will probably take him a couple hours) \n\nHe again acted excited at the thought of making money and when I asked him what he\u2019d spend it on he said games. We figured out new games would be about $60 and worked it out that I\u2019d pay him $20 for 3 weeks then $65 on the fourth week so he could cover tax because it might be hard for him to save. The fourth week he will do an extra little chore to cover the five bucks, like sweep off the porch or walkway.\n\nI hope I\u2019ve done the right thing and didn\u2019t make him think that everything just works out but I did my best to have him earn it. And hopefully showed an equal measure of kindness that he will carry with him. I also didn\u2019t want the mother to stress over replacing the phone as my mom was also a single mother and I know how tough it can be. My own son is just 2 so it was my first real opportunity to pass on some fatherly wisdom, which I hope is what I did.\n\nThanks for your input everyone. I really appreciate it.",

First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.\n\nThe night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u201cDear [Wife\u2019s name],\n\nI love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I\u2019m doing my best to help you but the fact that you won\u2019t help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don\u2019t make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I\u2019m ready to talk whenever you are.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[My name]\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nI put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her \u201cI love you so, so, much\u201d, and started crying too. I honestly don\u2019t know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could\u2019ve been 10 minutes, it could\u2019ve been an hour, I didn\u2019t care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don\u2019t know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words \u201cI really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.\u201d\n\nI was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She\u2019s always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.\n\nWe\u2019re not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.\n\nEDIT: I'm going to bed.

But just in case you haven\u2019t, this time of the year wasps and Yellowjackets (especially Yellowjackets) like to make nests inside of mailboxes. In a lot of places this time of the year, it\u2019s just beginning to warm up outside, but it\u2019s still fairly cold at night. So mailboxes provide nice, easy shelter for them. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times, especially during this part of the year, where I\u2019ve opened up a box to see a little nest with 3-5 Yellowjackets just chillin. If I\u2019m really unlucky, they will have made their nest at the very back of the box so I wind up sticking my hand in not knowing they are there. We all know how temperamental these little douchebags are and merely existing in their presence is enough to piss them off. Last year alone I was stung 10 times on 10 separate occasions. \n\nGetting to my point. We\u2019ve found that they hate scented dryer sheets. If we encounter a box that is a problem for nests, we\u2019ll often put one in there and it does the trick.\n\nSo please, if you one day randomly see a dryer sheet at the back of your mailbox, just know that your carrier more than likely put it there to deter these Satanic creatures from building their home in it.\n\nEdit: there\u2019s been a lot of good questions in the comments and I\u2019m having a heck of a time replying to them so let me just add an edit.\n\n\n\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t matter so much what brand you buy, if it\u2019s eco-friendly, or what scent it is. All that matters is that it is scented. The scent seems to be what deters them. So any scented dryer sheet should suffice!\n\n\nThis should only be used as a <em>preventative measure.</em> I\u2019ve never tried when there\u2019s a huge nest so I have no idea if it would work. I just immediately leave a note on the customer\u2019s door letting them know they need to take care of the nest before I can resume delivering their mail. It would be best to get rid of the large nest and then put a dryer sheet in to keep them from coming back.\n\n\nAs far as when to replace them, just check it periodically to see if the scent is still strong or if it has faded. The scent, once again, is what drives them away. So if the scent isn\u2019t as strong or it has completely faded, it\u2019s time to replace it.",

            "snippet": "This way anyone falsely accused does not get their name dragged through the sand until they have been convicted. We have made it too easy to destroy people's lives on false accusations. I believe protecting the innocent is just as important as prosecuting the guilty. The only downside would be if someone had evidence on the accused, but this could also be found as a part of the investigation process.\n\nSo maybe a better definition if the initial hearing is not dismissed and the judge wants to pursue the case further. I just don't think its fair to lose your job over something that's dismissed in 5 minutes in court, because that's all someone with a false accusation wants.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold.\n\nEdit: It seems the general consensus is that we all hate to see innocent people's lives ruined. Thank you for restoring my faith in humanity a little.\n\nEdit: The main counter argument (In my own words) - \"The government can abuse this by silently incarcerating and sentencing people, and it has been written into law (US) to release a public record of these events\". So my main problem with this argument is firstly I was referring to protecting innocent people from a false accusation, not from a tyrannical government. If you are being targeted by a tyrannical government, I don't think you really care about slander and being cancelled. However I did not know the reason behind this legislation (in the US) so I appreciate the info. What we should really define is at what point during the legal process does a public record get released? What forms of evidence are needed? Obviously video footage over word of mouth. The whole point of the legal system is you really can't trust people to tell the truth, doesn't matter because until you catch them in a lie you can't tell the difference. Can the media be sued for slander if they publish articles that corroborate a false accusation without doing enough research? Should they be forced to remove these articles or publically renounce any false information? These are all questions that came to mind when reading your comments. Again my main goal is protecting innocent citizens from the horrors of mob justice.\n\nEdit: I keep seeing Sweden pop up in my notifications tab. So shout out to Sweden for protecting the innocent.\n\nEdit: If this opinion was \"popular\" innocent people wouldn't have their lives ruined by this. I think we all know there is a problem and I am glad this post can foster discussion on the matter.\n\nEdit: \nGuys I said innocent people, not celebrities. /s Honestly, this doesn't really apply the same to someone who made a fortune based on their fame, since they are probably not employed anyways.",

            "snippet": "Why YSK: I used to be a drain cleaner. EVERY SINGLE DAY I had people coming to me for a second opinion because they were told they had to replace their sewer line for 5 grand. In the two years I spent drain cleaning, I only came across a whopping FOUR people that actually needed their sewer line replaced and well over a hundred that were told they had to. Here are some of the many tactics these companies use:\n\n-The most common one is that they couldn\u2019t get their blades past a blockage so the line must be broken. If this were true, the blades would come back with either mud on them, or completely clean and shiny. Even then, there are lots of other reasons why they could be shiny so it\u2019s not a definite break in the line.\n\n-They clean the line with small or sometimes even no blades. If it\u2019s the mainline, at least 3 inch blades should be used. Preferably 4 inch though. But some companies don\u2019t do that. So they will poke a hole into the blockage, and everything will run just fine...for a few days. Shortly after, that tiny hole will close again and you\u2019ll call them back out. They\u2019ll try to convince you it\u2019s because the line is broken when it\u2019s not.\n\n-They make you think roots in the mainline are a huge deal and the line must be replaced. Roots are the most common cause of sewer line backups. It\u2019s incredibly common and should be expected if you have a tree near your sewer line. Some people will go ten years before their first root caused backup because it can take time for the roots to get through the pipe. Your sewer line is still in good shape. Just get it snaked every year and use root killer to slow the growth. \n\n-They scope the line and find bellies with sitting water or small offsets. While not ideal, most houses have them and it\u2019s not necessarily a big deal. It\u2019s something to keep an eye on, not waste 5-10 grand on.\n\nHere\u2019s some general tips regarding the trade:\n\n-If the company doesn\u2019t have the prices online, don\u2019t tell them if you\u2019re renting out the house. If you\u2019re a landlord they\u2019ll assume you\u2019ve got extra cash and up charge you.\n\n-If your basement has a floor drain, get a $10 water alarm. If it ever backs up, you\u2019ll know immediately and stop the spread of water before it causes massive amounts of damage. This is particularly important if you don\u2019t go into the basement often. I once went to an elderly lady\u2019s house that had a foot of water in the basement. She was too old to go downstairs and didn\u2019t notice the smell because she was hooked up to an oxygen tank thingy. Decades of memories stored in boxed were destroyed. \n\n-If you have a sewer line scoped, make sure you see them do it yourself. They like to swap footage with another house and act like your line is broken. Also make sure they use at least 3 inch blades on your mainline. Also make sure to get a copy of the footage. You can send it to multiple companies and they\u2019ll usually give you their opinion for free so you don\u2019t need it scoped multiple times!\n\n-Clean out the p-traps to your sinks. I\u2019ve had dozens of people call me to spend five minutes unscrewing their trap, cleaning it out, the putting it back. When I try to tell them that it\u2019s easy to do yourself they say they don\u2019t mess around with anything plumbing related. But seriously, watch a two minute video and do it yourself in 5 minutes and save a hundred bucks. \n\n-DO NOT FLUSH ANYTHING DOWN THE TOILET UNLESS IT CAME OUT OF YOU, OR ITS TOILET PAPER!!!! It doesn\u2019t matter if your wipes say they\u2019re \u201cflushable\u201d. it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s \u201cjust a few tampons\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter if you \u201cdidn\u2019t think your kid was dumb enough to flush his cat stuffed animal\u201d. Don\u2019t do it! Just because it gets past the toilet doesn\u2019t mean it gets through the whole line. If you\u2019re flushing wipes or tampons, there\u2019s a good chance your just collecting them and one day you will be met with a very unpleasant surprise. I\u2019ve seen anywhere from a couple tampons clogging the line to filling up HALF OF A FIVE GALLON BUCKET with tampons. The only thing worse than spending 10 hours fishing for tampons is spending a thousand bucks for someone to fish for your tampons. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to it but I\u2019m doubtful many will even read this. Which is a shame because I saw people getting scammed every single day and it\u2019s easily avoidable. Most people don\u2019t know much of this and these companies know that. And they take advantage of it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, don\u2019t use any draino or anything similar. It\u2019s very acidic. It can melt away pipes overtime and does a very poor job anyways. It usually only pokes holes into things. Save your pipes and clean out the trap yourself by hand, or call someone to do it.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend never using a snake yourself for the mainline, or even really a kitchen line. I have no idea how places like Home Depot are allowed to rent them out to just anyone. I know people that were trained to use them and still lost a finger. If you\u2019re not incredibly familiar with it you can go from being just fine to missing a finger in literally a split second. Spend the extra hundred dollars and have a professional do it. It takes a long time to be trained to use it and messing up or not knowing how to use it properly can cost you a finger or two.\n\nAlso, if your toilets start to bubble/gargle when you run any water, your line is most likely going to be backing up. You could have a backup in one minute, or in a week. It\u2019s best to have someone out ASAP!\n\nPeople are asking why you shouldn\u2019t use the snake yourself or how I could cause a lot of damage. This is why. BE WARNED, THIS IS NSFW AND GOREY. And this isn\u2019t even the worst that can happen!\n\nAlso, drain cleaners love kitchen sink disposals because it keeps them in business. The more food you put down, the more likely it will get clogged. Especially avoid greasy foods, egg shells, and coffee grounds. If you\u2019d like to avoid a backup, don\u2019t put any food down the sink and use a paper towel to wipe off excess grease on dishes!\n\nAs much as I would love to, it has become impossible to keep up with all of these comments! If you have a question, I\u2019d recommend saving this post and then messaging me in a day or two! Thanks for all of the awards! I hope this post can help you save some money and make scammer companies lose some business!",

            "snippet": "Given the unprecedented events today and my contributions about the history of American elections on the forum over the last year, I've been asked by the mods here at /r/AskHistorians to write a little bit about how today's events might be viewed in the context of American history.  This is an unusual thread for unusual times, and I would ask for the understanding of those who might be inclined to immediately respond as if it were a normal Reddit political thread.  It isn't.\n\nIt's a real doozy, though, ain't it; I don't think any of us would have ever expected to see our fellow citizens nowadays storming Congress, disrupting the electoral process and carrying off rostrums.  But it's happened, and what I'll say to start is something simple: on the Federal level, this is indeed unprecedented.  Oh, you can certainly talk about the Civil War as an entirely different level of sedition, and varying attempts to suppress the franchise have been a constant theme from the beginnings of the Republic.  But this is the first time that the United States has not negotiated the transfer of power peacefully during a Presidential transition, and it's worth reviewing how it dodged the bullets in the past.\n\nAfter the Election of 1800, Jefferson himself feared that the lame duck Federalist Congress would attempt to use the accidental deadlock in the Electoral College between him and Aaron Burr as justification to place one of their own as Acting President for the remainder of 1801 until the convening of the new Democratic Republican-controlled House in December.  There is evidence that he and others working on his behalf - namely the Democratic-Republican Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania - would have called out the militia to storm Washington to prevent this.  Fortunately, thanks to Federalist James Bayard of Delaware, this did not come to pass as Jefferson won the runoff, and the first peaceful transition of power in the United States resulted.\n\nIn 1876, the successful efforts by Republicans to shift 20 electoral votes from Democratic nominee Samuel Tilden to Republican nominee Rutherford Hayes during recounts in South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana produced threats of violence as well.  George McClellan actively attempted to gain support in raising a militia to install Tilden, and in response to perceived threats of violence by him and others, then-President Grant reactivated Civil War forts surrounding Washington.  Fortunately, for reasons we are still unsure of, Tilden was lukewarm about the prospect, spent the first month writing legal briefs on the illegitimacy of the Hayes recount rather than politicking, and with numerous Southern Democrats already having reached a deal with Hayes' operatives to remove Federal troops from the South if he were to be elected, ultimately decided that he probably could not win even in the Democratic-controlled House and chose not to contest the election.  Again, a peaceful transition of power resulted.\n\nThis has not, however, been the case for large parts of American history on the state level.\n\nIn 1838, a gubernatorial election in Pennsylvania led to what has been called the \"Buckshot War.\"  A gubernatorial election had ousted the incumbent Whig/Anti-Masonist by a slim margin of 5000 votes, both Democrats and Whigs claimed voter fraud (which both likely committed), and because of the resulting fights over who had won the state House elections in the districts that were disputed never resolved, two separate bodies claiming be the lawful Pennsylvania House of Representatives - one controlled by Whigs, the other Democrats - were formed.  This produced an interesting scene at the State House when, \"...before they began their separate deliberations, both groups attempted to occupy the physical building in which the official Pennsylvania House of Representatives was to meet, with some pushing and shoving as their two different speakers simultaneously took to the podium.\"\n\nSince both the state House and Senate were required to vote to declare the lawful winner, and the Senate was controlled by their party, Whigs had a path to retaining their governor if they managed to hold on to the House.  This led to a declaration by the Whig Secretary of State of Pennsylvania, Thomas Burrowes, that even for the times was remarkable: not only would he disallow the Democratic returns that were in dispute, but that members of his party should behave \"as if we had not been defeated\" since \"an honest count would put (their candidate) ahead by 10,000 votes.\"  One historian has described this as \"a coup d'etat.\"\n\nThis was made worse by the incumbent governor calling out the state militia, ostensibly to keep the peace but in reality to attempt to shut Democrats out.  Fortunately, state militia commander General Robert Patterson told the Governor directly that he would protect lives and property but under no terms would intervene in the conflict, \"\u201cIf ordered to clear the Capitol and install in the chair either or both of the Speakers, (I) would not do it.\u201d Likewise, \u201cif ordered to fire upon those [the Whigs] chose to call rebels, (I) would not do it [either].\u201d  (His orders for his troops to arm themselves with buckshot gave the dispute its name.)  Frustrated, the Governor sent the militia home, requested federal troops, and received the following response from President Van Buren: \"To interfere in [this] commotion,\u201d which \u201cgrows out of a political contest,\u201d would have \u201cdangerous consequences to our republican institutions.\"\n\nUltimately, the conflict ended with three Whigs defecting and providing the Democratic side of the house a quorum to certify the election of the disputed Democrats and the Democratic governor, but the potential for bloodshed was very much real; in fact, while plotting with Burrowes for Whig control of both houses so he might gain election to the US Senate (this was in the days of legislatures electing Senators), Thaddeus Stevens was the subject of an assassination plot that resulted in both men escaping from a basement window in bare possession of their lives.\n\nI don't have time currently to detail it all, but this was a pattern that repeated elsewhere many times during the 19th century.  Bashford against Barstow in Wisconsin in 1856 nearly got another militia battle, Bleeding Kansas and the bloody Lecompton pro-slave legislature in 1857 onwards outright previewed the Civil War, and Kentucky in 1899 had the Democratic candidate for governor outright assassinated in the midst of counting ballots.  Add in local disputes and the list gets longer; democracy has had very rough edges at times.\n\nBut I would urge you to take heart.  Even in chaos, today's United States is still not 1872 Louisiana, where something like 100 African Americans were brutally murdered at Colfax following a dispute over a gubernatorial election.  Nor is it 1876 South Carolina, where perhaps 150 were killed in pre-election violence where both Democrats and Republicans attempted to rig the election by shooting at each other.\n\nMaybe it won't end up doing so at the Capitol, but Congress will convene, the election will be concluded, and the will of the people recognized.  We will learn and grow from it, move on, and create a more perfect union. \n\nHang in there, folks.\n\nEdit: A couple typos, and yes, as many have pointed Wilmington is one of those local events I was referring to that was equally as ugly as some of the ones I've mentioned on the state level.
