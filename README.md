## Integrations

### Running Experiments on the AQL

The data in the Archive Query Log is highly sensitive (still, you
can [re-crawl everything from the Wayback Machine](#crawling)). For that reason, we ensure that custom experiments or
analyses can not leak sensitive data (please [get in touch](#contribute) if you have questions) by
using [TIRA](https://tira.io) as a platform for custom analyses/experiments. In TIRA, you submit a Docker image that
implements your experiment. Your software is then executed in sandboxed mode (without internet connection) to ensure
that your software does not leak sensitive information. After your software execution finished, administrators will
review your submission and unblind it so that you can access the outputs.  
Please refer to our [dedicated TIRA tutorial](integrations/tira/README.md) as starting point for your experiments.

## Crawling

For running the CLI and crawl a query log on your own machine, 
please refer to the [instructions for single-machine deployments](#single-machine-pypidocker).
If instead you want to scale up and run the crawling pipelines on a cluster,
please refer to the [instructions for cluster deployments](#cluster-helmkubernetes).

### Single-Machine (PyPi/Docker)

To run the Archive Query Log CLI on your machine, 
you can either use our [PyPi package](#installation-pypi) or the [Docker image](#installation-docker).
(If you absolutely need to, you can also install the [Python CLI](#installation-python-from-source) 
or the Docker image from source.)

#### Installation (PyPi)

First you need to install [Python 3.10](https://python.org/downloads/) and 
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/) (this allows you to install the AQL CLI in a virtual environment).
Then, you can install the Archive Query Log CLI by running:
```shell
pipx install archive-query-log
```

Now you can run the Archive Query Log CLI by running:
```shell
aql --help
```

#### Installation (Python from source)

<details>

First install [Python 3.10](https://python.org/downloads/), and clone this repository.
From inside the repository directory, create a virtual environment and activate it:
```shell
python3.10 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the Archive Query Log by running:
```shell
pip install -e .
```

Now you can run the Archive Query Log CLI by running:
```shell
aql --help
```

</details>

#### Installation (Docker)

You only need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

**Note:** The commands below use the syntax of the [PyPi installation](#installation-pypi).
To run the same commands with the Docker installation, replace `aql`
with `docker run -it -v "$(pwd)"/config.override.yml:/workspace/config.override.yml ghcr.io/webis-de/archive-query-log`,
for example:

```shell
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)"/config.override.yml:/workspace/config.override.yml ghcr.io/webis-de/archive-query-log --help
```

#### Installation (Docker from source)

<details>

First install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), and clone this repository.
From inside the repository directory, build the Docker image like this:

```shell
docker build -t aql .
```

**Note:** The commands below use the syntax of the [PyPi installation](#installation-pypi).
To run the same commands with the Docker installation, replace `aql`
with `docker run -it -v "$(pwd)"/config.override.yml:/workspace/config.override.yml aql`,
for example:

```shell
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)"/config.override.yml:/workspace/config.override.yml aql --help
```

</details>

#### Configuration

Crawling the Archive Query Log requires access to an Elasticsearch cluster and some S3 block storage.
To configure access to the Elasticsearch cluster and S3, 
add a `config.override.yml` file in the current directory, with the following contents.
Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials:

```yaml
es:
  host: "<HOST>"
  port: 9200
  username: "<USERNAME>"
  password: "<PASSWORD>"
s3:
   endpoint_url: "<URL>"
   bucket_name: archive-query-log
   access_key: "<KEY>"
   secret_key: "<KEY>"
```

#### Toy Example: Crawl ChatNoir SERPs from the Wayback Machine

The crawling pipeline of the Archive Query Log can best be understood by looking at a small toy example.
Here, we want to crawl and parse SERPs of the [ChatNoir search engine](https://chatnoir.eu) 
from the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org).

<!-- TODO: Add example instructions. -->

#### Add an archive service

Add new web archive services (e.g., the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org)) to the AQL by running:

```shell
aql archives add
```

We maintain a list of compatible web archives [below](#compatible-archives).

##### Compatible archives

The web archives below are known to be compatible with the Archive Query Log crawler and can be used to mine SERPs.

<!-- TODO: Extend this list. -->

| Name                                       | CDX API URL                            | Memento API URL              |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) | https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx | https://web.archive.org/web/ |


#### Add a search provider

Add new search providers (e.g., [Google](https://google.com)) to the AQL by running:

```shell
aql providers add
```

A search provider can be any website that offers some kind of search functionality.
Ideally, you should also look at common prefixes of the URLs of the search results pages (e.g., `/search` for Google).
Narrowing down URL prefixes helps to not crawl too many captures that do not contain search results.

Refer to the [import instructions below](#import) to import providers from the AQL-22 YAML file format.

#### Build source pairs


Once you have added at least one [archive](#add-an-archive-service) and one [search provider](#add-a-search-provider),
we want to crawl archived captures of SERPs for each search provider and for each archive service,
that is, we compute the cross product of archives and the search providers' domains
and URL prefixes (roughly: archiveÃ—provider).
Start building source pairs (i.e., archiveâ€“provider pairs) by running:

```shell
aql sources build
```

Running the command again after adding more archives or providers automatically creates the missing source pairs.

#### Fetch captures

For each [source pair](#build-source-pairs), we now fetch captures from the archive service, that correspond
to the provider's domain and URL prefix given in the source pair.

```shell
aql captures fetch
```

Again, running the command again after adding more source pairs automatically fetches the missing captures.

#### Parse SERP URLs

Not every capture necessarily points to a search engine result page (SERP).
But usually, SERPs contain the user query in the URL, so we can filter out non-SERP captures by parsing the URLs.

```shell
aql serps parse url-query
```

Parsing the query from the capture URL will add SERPs to a new, more focused index that only contains SERPs.
From the SERPs, we can also parse the page number and offset of the SERP, if available.

```shell
aql serps parse url-page
aql serps parse url-offset
```

All the above commands can be run in parallel, and they can be run multiple times to update the SERP index.
Already parsed SERPs will be skipped.

#### Download SERP WARCs

Up to this point, we have only fetched the metadata of the captures, most prominently the URL.
However, the snippets of the SERPs are not contained in the metadata, but only on the web page.
So we need to download the actual web pages from the archive service.

```shell
aql serps download warc
```

This command will download the contents of each SERP to a WARC file that is stored in the configured S3 bucket.
A pointer to the WARC file is stored in the SERP index so that we can quickly access a specific SERP's contents later.

#### Parsing SERP WARCs

From the WARC, we can again parse the query as it appears on the SERP.

```shell
aql serps parse serp-query
```

More importantly, we can parse the snippets of the SERP.

```shell
aql serps parse serp-snippets
```

Parsing the snippets from the SERP's WARC contents will also add the SERP's results to a new index.

#### Download SERP WARCs

To get the full text of each referenced result from the SERP, we need to download a capture of the result from 
the web archive. Intuitively, we would like to download a capture of the result at the exact same time as the SERP 
was captured. But often, web archives crawl the results later or not at all. We therefore search for 
the nearest captures before and after the SERP's timestamp and download these two captures for each result, 
if any could be found.

```shell
aql results download warc
```

This will again download the result's contents to a WARC file that is stored in the configured S3 bucket.
A pointer to the WARC file is stored in the result index for random access to a specific result's contents.

### Import

We support automatically importing providers and parsers from the AQL-22 YAML-file format
(see [`data/selected-services.yaml`](data/selected-services.yaml)).
To import the services and parsers from the AQL-22 YAML file, run:

```shell
aql providers import
aql parsers url-query import
aql parsers url-page import
aql parsers url-offset import
aql parsers warc-query import
aql parsers warc-snippets import
```

We also support importing a previous crawl of captures from the AQL-22 file system backend:

```shell
aql captures import aql-22
```

Last, we support importing all archives from the [Archive-It]() web archive service:

```shell
aql archives import archive-it
```

### Cluster (Helm/Kubernetes)
Running the Archive Query Log on a cluster is recommended for large-scale crawls.
We provide a Helm chart that automatically starts crawling and parsing jobs for you
and stores the results in an Elasticsearch cluster.

#### Installation
Just install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) and configure `kubectl` for your cluster.

#### Configuration

Crawling the Archive Query Log requires access to an Elasticsearch cluster and some S3 block storage.
Configure the Elasticsearch and S3 credentials in a `values.override.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  host: "<HOST>"
  port: 9200
  username: "<USERNAME>"
  password: "<PASSWORD>"
s3:
  endpoint_url: "<URL>"
  bucket_name: archive-query-log
  access_key: "<KEY>"
  secret_key: "<KEY>"
```

#### Deployment

Let's deploy the Helm chart on the cluster (we're testing first with `--dry-run` to see if everything works):

```shell
helm upgrade --install --values helm/archive-query-log/values.override.yaml --dry-run archive-query-log helm/archive-query-log
```

If everything worked and the output looks good, you can remove the `--dry-run` flag to actually deploy the chart.

#### Uninstall

If you no longer need the chart, you can uninstall it:

```shell
helm uninstall archive-query-log
```

## Development

Refer to the local [Python installation](#installation-python-from-source) instructions to set up the development
environment and install the dependencies.

Then, also install the test dependencies:
```shell
pip install -e .[tests]
```

After having implemented a new feature, you should the check code format, inspect common LINT errors, 
and run all unit tests with the following commands:

```shell
flake8 archive_query_log  # Code format
pylint archive_query_log  # LINT errors
mypy archive_query_log    # Static typing
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r archive_query_log  # Security
pytest archive_query_log  # Unit tests
```

### Add new tests for parsers

At the moment, our workflow for adding new tests for parsers goes like this:

1. Select the number of tests to run per service and the number of services.
2. Auto-generate unit tests and download WARCs
   with [generate_tests.py](archive_query_log/legacy/results/test/generate_tests.py)
3. Run the tests.
4. Failing tests will open a diff editor with the approval and a web browser tab with the Wayback URL.
5. Use the web browser dev tools to find the query input field and search result CSS paths.
6. Close diffs and tabs and re-run tests.

## Abstract

The Archive Query Log (AQL) is a previously unused, comprehensive query log collected at the Internet Archive over the
last 25 years. Its first version includes 356 million queries, 166 million search result pages, and 1.7 billion search
results across 550 search providers. Although many query logs have been studied in the literature, the search providers
that own them generally do not publish their logs to protect user privacy and vital business data. Of the few query logs
publicly available, none combines size, scope, and diversity. The AQL is the first to do so, enabling research on new
retrieval models and (diachronic) search engine analyses. Provided in a privacy-preserving manner, it promotes open
research as well as more transparency and accountability in the search industry.
